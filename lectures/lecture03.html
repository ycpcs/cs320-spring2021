      <h2 id="version-control">Version Control</h2>

      <p>Version control is a way to keep track of changes made over time and enables the ability to revert to certain changes if necessary.
				Some version control systems record only changes, but git records something more akin to snapshots.
				However, at each snapshot, it does not re-store files if they have not been changed. Instead, it stores a link to the previous identical file.
			This makes git much more efficient than other verion control systems. </p>
			<p> At this stage (and most stages) of your CS career, it is not very important to understand <i> how </i> git works. It works, and it works well.
				Knowing how to use it is critical and will make you much more employable because everyone uses git.
				This is how you will work on projects for the rest of your technical life, so it is time to <b> git gud. </b>

        <h2 id="version-control">A Brief History of git</h2>
        <p>
          To talk about the history of git you must first talk about the history of Linux. The Linux
          kernel is a very large and very old open source project. Open Source means that is has
          many people working on it, not connected to any organization or business. This creates a
          problem, however; how do contributors share and combine their work, with everyone working
          at the same time? The answer is version control. In the beginning, also known as the 90s,
          changes were passed around as patches and archived files. This was not much better than
          emailing files back and forth. In 2002, the Linux Community moved to BitKeeper, a
          propietary, but at the time free, version control software. Then in 2005, it became not
          free. This made a lot of people unhappy and was widely considered a bad move. Linux people
          did not want to go back to emailing files back and forth, so Linus Torvalds did what Linus
          Torvalds does, and made his own version control system. Thus, git was born. It had a lot
          of improvements over other version control systems, like branching, and quickly became the
          most widely used version control system, much to the dismay of everyone trying to make
          money off of version control. It remains free and open source, managed by a non-profit. If
          you want to know anything (or everything) there is to know about git, you can go to
          <a href="https://git-scm.com">https://git-scm.com</a> where there are comprehensive
          reference manuals and guides, all for free.

          <li>Verify your e-mail</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you did not use a .edu email, go to your account settings and add your .edu email

        <p>
          Git Clients are a visual alternative to doing git through command line. There are many
          different options for Git Clients. This page walks you through using two free choices:
          GitHub Desktop and GitKraken. GitHub Desktop is bare bones and very easy to use, but
          doesn't have many extra features. GitKraken has more features (and a pro version), and
          also has a visual display of your repository's branches. (more on branches later)

      <h2 id="version-control">Part 3: Create a Repository</h2>
      <ul>
        <p>
          A repository (or repo) is where your code is stored. You have a remote repository, that is
          located on a service like GitHub, and a local repository, on your machine. You work on the
          code on your local repository, and then commit your changes and push them to your remote
          repository. When you are starting a new repository it is always easier to create your
          remote repository first, and then bring it to your machine.
        </p>
        <h3>On GitHub</h3>

        <ul>
          <p>
            To create a new repository on GitHub, you can either hit the green "New" button next to
            "Repositories" on the left of the home page, or click the "+" menu by your profile in
            the upper right and select "New Repository." This will take you to a new page:

            <ul>
              <li>
                Public repositories can be seen by everyone, private repositories can only be seen
                by added collaborators
              </li>

          <p><b>Optional:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Add a README - This is a long description of your repository and what it's about (this
              is highly recommended)
            </li>
            <li>
              Add .gitignore - This file tells git which files in your repo not to track. It is very
              useful for Java because you do not want to commit .class files (a repository is only
              for source code)
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                GitHub is nice and has template .gitignore files based on the language you are
                using.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              Add a License - GitHub is dedicated to supporting open source, but an important part
              of open source is letting people know what can and cannot be done with your code. A
              license is a document that states those rules. GitHub has
              <a href="https://choosealicense.com">https://choosealicense.com</a>
              to help you pick one.
            </li>

      <h1 id="version-control">git mechanics</h1>
      <h2 id="version-control">How to git it</h2>
      <ul>
        <p>
          Git saves your work, but only when you tell it to. The process for telling it what to save
          to your repository is called committing. The repository on your machine is called your
          local repository. The repository on GitHub is called your remote or upstream repository.
          To save changes to your local repository you do "git add" and then "git commit". To move
          changes from your local repository to your remote repository you must do a "git push" git
          tracks any and all changes made to the repository. These changes, until you tell git
          otherwise, are "unstaged," which means that git will not record them. To stage these
          changes you must do a "git add". To add these to your local repository you must do a "git
          commit" The direction below explain how to do this process on GitHub Desktop and
          GitKraken.
        </p>

      <h1>git collaboration</h1>
      <ul>
        <p>
          The process of add, commit, push is all good and fine when you are working by yourself.
          <b> IT DOES NOT WORK </b>when you are working in a team. To effectively work in a team you
          must use branches. Before you branch, you must pull. Before you do any of that, you must
          add collaborators to your repository.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <h2>Step 0: Add Collaborators</h2>
      <ul>
        <p>
          Collaborators are people who are authorized to work on your repository. To add them go to
          the settings tab and click "Manage access" and then "Invite a collaborator"
        </p>
        <img src="/cs320-spring2021/lectures/git/invite.png" width="50%" height="50%" />
        <p>
          A window will come up where you can look up GitHub users by username or email. Select who
          you want to invite, and GitHub will send an invite to their email. They must accept this
          email before they can do anything with the repo.
        </p>
        <img src="/cs320-spring2021/lectures/git/lookup.png" width="50%" height="50%" />
        <h3>A Word of Advice</h3>
          <p>
            Collaborators can do anything to your repository that you can do, with few limitations.
            When people do not know what they are doing, or abuse their privleges, things can get
            very messy very quickly. While you are in the Settings menu, it is highly reccomended
            that you click on "Branches" and then "Add rule"
          </p>
          <img src="/cs320-spring2021/lectures/git/addRule.png" width="50%" height="50%" />
          <p>After that apply the following settings and click the green "Create" button:</p>
          <img src="/cs320-spring2021/lectures/git/branchRule.png" width="70%" height="70%" />
          <p>
            These settings means no one can make and apply changes without someone else reviewing
            and approving them. This will make your life easier.
          </p>
				<section>
        <h2>Step 1: pull</h2>
        <ul>
          <p>
            Before you make a branch you must check to make sure there are no new changes on the
            remote. To get these changes you must "fetch" the remote and "pull" the changes into
            your local repository
          </p>

		        <div class="two-col">
		          <section>
		            <h3>GitHub Desktop</h3>
									<p>
										GitHub Desktop will usually regularly fetch for you, but it is good practice to click
										the "Fetch" button in the top bar to make sure it is up to date. If there are changes,
										the "Fetch" button will change to a "Pull" button. Clicking "Pull" will merge these
										changes into your local repository. If this does not work, go to the section labeled
										"git conflicts"
									</p>
									<img src="/cs320-spring2021/lectures/git/GitHubPull.png" width="85%"/>
							</section>

		          <section>
		            <h3>GitKraken</h3>
								<p>
									GitKraken will fetch and pull in one click. All you need to do is click the "Pull"
									button at the top of the window. If this does not work, go to the section labeled "git
									conflicts"
								</p>
								<img src="/cs320-spring2021/lectures/git/GitKrakenPull.png" width="70%"/>
							</section>
		        </div>
		      </section>


					<section>
						<h2>Step 2: branch</h2>
						<p>
							Your main branch should always contain working code. You should
							<b>never</b> program on your main branch. Any new features, patches, bug fixes, etc should have their <b> own </b> branch.
							This helps prevent merge conflicts and ensures that the main branch is always working. As previously mentioned, you should always pull from the main remote branch,
							and then create a new branch.
						</p>
						<div class="two-col">
							<section>
								<h3>GitHub Desktop</h3>
								<p>GitHub Desktop has a tab on the top bar that tells you which branch you are on.
									Clicking this will show all your branches and give you the opportunity to create a new branch by clicking "New branch."
									Your branch name should describe what is being done on it.</p>
									<img src="/cs320-spring2021/lectures/git/GitHubBranch.png" width="70%"/>
							</section>

							<section>
								<h3>GitKraken</h3>
								<p>GitKraken shows you your current branch on the left of the top bar.
									You can create a new branch by clicking the "Branch" button in the middle of the top bar.
								Your branch name should describe what is being done on it.</p>
								<img src="/cs320-spring2021/lectures/git/GitKrakenBranch.png" width="70%"/>

		        <h2>Step 3: code</h2>
						<p>
							This step should be obvious, but you never know. Once you are on your branch, you may proceed with work as normal.
						</p>
		      </section>

					<section>
		        <h2>Step 4: commit</h2>
						<p>
							You should commit at logical checkpoints in your progress, like fixing a bug, or finishing a section of logic.
							When you commit, you should follow the steps as outlined in git mechanics. They will work the same way, except instead of pushing to the main branch,
							you will be pushing your branch to the remote repository. (GitHub Desktop calls this "Publishing" the branch.) Once your branch is in the remote repository <b> and you are ready to merge it to the main branch </b>, you may proceed to step 5.
						</p>
		      </section>

					<section>
						<h2>Step 5: pull request</h2>
						<p>
							It is time to return to your repository on GitHub, and refresh the page if you have left it open. At the top of the repository you should see and alert that "[branch-name] had recent pushes" with a green button that says "Compare & pull request."
							Click the button.
						</p>
						<img src="/cs320-spring2021/lectures/git/compare.png" width="70%"/>
						<p>
							This will lead you to a form for opening a pull request, comparing your branch to the main branch. It will auto fill with your commit message as the title, but you can add more description of what you did in the branch in the comment field.
							When you are done, click the "Create pull request" button.
						</p>
						<img src="/cs320-spring2021/lectures/git/openPR.png" width="70%"/>
						<p>
							If you set up the previously reccomended repository rule, one of your collaborators must review and approve your pull request. The format of the pull request allows for comments and discussion, so teammates can discuss changes.
							If you did not, you should be able to merge it automatically, by clicking the "Merge pull request" button. If you cannot merge it, GitHub will not let you, because you have a merge conflict. Please go to the section labeled "merge conflicts" to learn more about this.
							Otherwise, congratulations, you have merged your branch! Return to step 1.
