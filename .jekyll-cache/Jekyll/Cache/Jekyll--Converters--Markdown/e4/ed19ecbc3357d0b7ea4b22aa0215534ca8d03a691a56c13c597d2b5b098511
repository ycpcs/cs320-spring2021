<p>This is an <strong>Individual</strong> assignment.</p>

<h1 id="individual-project">Individual Project</h1>

<p>Software development is a vast and rapidly-changing field.
Almost any substantial project will require you to learn about
new technologies, which could include programming languages,
libraries, databases, etc.  Being able to learn
new technologies on your own
and use them effectively in a project is an essential skill
for a software developer.</p>

<p>Your task in this assignment is to propose an individual project
you will work on this semester that involves one or more technologies
related to software development that will be a new learning experience
for you.</p>

<p>Some possible examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learn a new programming environment, e.g. C#, .NET, and MS Visual Studio; Android and IntelliJ; Python, PyCharm, and Pygame</li>
  <li>Learn a new programming language, e.g., Clojure, Scala, Erlang
and write a non-trivial program in that language</li>
  <li>Learn about JavaScript (JS) and AJAX for rich web client interfaces,
develop a web application.  Thee are many forms of JS from which to choose</li>
  <li>Try developing your own website using Grails or Ruby on Rails</li>
  <li>Learn about programming embedded systems and hardware interfacing, 
e.g., AVR, Arduino, and then use it in a hardware project (a data logger,
robot, etc.)</li>
  <li>Contact the <strong>Radio Telescope team</strong> and learn how to develop in the languages, platforms, and tools they are using for that project.  This would prepare you to work on that project when you reach CS481/CS482 - Senior Design I and II.</li>
  <li>Learn how to deploy and host a website through Amazon Web Services (AWS)</li>
</ul>

<p>These are just examples: I encourage you to be creative and
think of something that interests you personally.  The most important
requirement is that you should learn something new!</p>

<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

<p>The project should be smaller in scope than your team project:
the purpose is more to learn something new than to create a substantial
software system.  However, your project must be non-trivial: the
system you create should do something interesting.</p>

<h1 id="proposal-format">Proposal Format</h1>

<p>Your proposal should be 2-3 pages, and contain the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Description of your project</li>
  <li>List one or more technologies related to software development that you
will learn about</li>
  <li>Briefly discuss your plan for the project: list what sources of information you plan to use, and provide a list of steps/intermediate goals that will allow you to make progress towards completing the project.  Keep in mind that I expect you to make steady progress, and that there will be regular in-class progress reports/demos, as specified in <a href="assign04.html">Assignment 4</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the template for your <a href="CS320_Individual_Project_Proposal_Template.pdf">Individual Project Proposal</a>.  Download the <a href="CS320_Individual_Project_Proposal_Template.docx">template document</a>, modify it, as necessary, and follow the submission instructions below.</p>

<h1 id="submitting">Submitting</h1>

<p>Create a folder in Google Drive named ‚ÄúCS320-IndProject-username‚Äù, replacing ‚Äúusername‚Äù with your YCP user name, and place it in the shared Google <strong>CS320-Spring2020 [students]</strong> folder under your section of CS320 that I previously shared with you.</p>

<p>This folder will be your means of submission for all <strong>non-programming-related individual</strong> assignments.</p>

<p>Then create your Individual Project Proposal in that folder, using Google Docs.  Name your Project Proposal document <strong>assign02-username</strong>, again substituting your YCP user name.  Share the folder and its contents with me.</p>

<div class="callout">
<b>Important</b>: Only submissions in Google Docs will be accepted.
Do not submit a document in any other format!
