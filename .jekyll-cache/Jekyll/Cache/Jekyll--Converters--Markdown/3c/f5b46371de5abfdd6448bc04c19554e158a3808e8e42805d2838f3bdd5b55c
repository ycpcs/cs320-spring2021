  <div class="callout"><b>When you implement the persistence layer using Derby for your team project</b>: when specifying the JDBC URL in the code where you connect to the database, you should use an absolute file name for the database name. For example, <code>jdbc:derby:H:/mydatabase.db;create=true</code> (this will create the database as <code>H:/mydatabase.db</code>).  If you use a relative file name, your web application will probably not find the database (because it runs in the <code>war</code> directory rather than the root directory of the project).</div>

<h1 id="cs320-library-example-project">CS320 Library Example Project</h1>

<p><a href="CS320_LibraryExample-2020.zip">CS320_LibraryExample-2020.zip</a>: Eclipse project that ties the <a href="../labs/lab02.html">Web Applications Lab</a> together with the <a href="../labs/lab06.html">ORM Lab</a>.  This application places a web front-end on the SQL transactions from Lab06, as well as provides examples for creating a Derby database from CSV files, how to use session information after login, and how to use JSTL to display a list of complex objects in a JSP.  It has been updated to incorporate a many-to-many (M2M) relationship between <strong>Books</strong> and <strong>Authors</strong>, using a junction table (<strong>booksAuthors</strong>) that cross-references <strong>book_id</strong>’s with <strong>author_id</strong>’s.  It also contains some basic (non-exhaustive) JUnit Tests for testing the Derby database queries.</p>

<blockquote>
  <div class="callout"><b>NOTE: You are free to incorporate any of this code into your team project(s) - as long as you cite the source in your code, and refactor the names from **Lab02** and **Lab06** to something that pertains to your project.</b></div>
</blockquote>

<p>After you download the ZIP file, extract it into a new Java workspace separate from the others that you have used in the past.  This project is composed of 4 separate Java projects (<strong>CS320_Jetty</strong>, <strong>CS320_Derby</strong>, <strong>CS320_LibraryExample_Lab02</strong>, and <strong>CS320_LibraryExample_Lab06</strong>).</p>

<p>Before running the project, open up <strong>DerbyDatabase.java</strong> under <strong>CS320_LibraryExample_Lab06-&gt;src-&gt;edu.ycp.cs320.booksdb.persist</strong> and edit the Derby database location in the <strong>connect()</strong> method so that it has the absolute path where you want your database to be located.  Do the same thing in <strong>SQLDemo.java</strong> in the <strong>main()</strong> method.  If you don’t change it, the default database location will be <strong>C:/CS320-2020-LibraryExample-DB/</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>DO NOT LOCATE YOUR DATABASE WITHIN THE LibraryExample PROJECT.</strong>  You will likely be using the LibraryExample as the basis for your team project, and placing the database within the project will eventually result in numerous <strong>Git</strong> conflicts when you start working as a team from a common <strong>Git</strong> repository.</p>

<p>Run <strong>DerbyDatabase.java</strong> as an application to create the Library database from the <strong>authors.csv</strong>, <strong>books.csv</strong>, and <strong>bookAuthors.csv</strong> files. It might take a few seconds for the application to create the DB - you will see it in the console.  Afterwards, <strong>library.db</strong> will show up as a folder under the <strong>C:/CS320-2020-LibraryExample-DB/</strong> folder.  If you changed the LibraryExample database location, you will find <strong>library.db</strong> at that location.</p>

<p>Run <strong>SQLDemo.java</strong> as an application so that you can issue SQL queries to the LibraryExample DB.  If this step works - if you can issue queries and SQLDemo can locate the DB - then you have correctly updated the two Java source files from above.</p>

<p>To run the web application, first stop <strong>SQLDemo</strong>, then run <strong>CS320_LibraryExample_Lab02-&gt;Main.java</strong> as a Java application, followed by entering the following URL in your web browser:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://localhost:8081/lab02/login">http://localhost:8081/lab02/login</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are currently two sets of login credentials hard-coded into the application: User name: <strong>student</strong> with PW: <strong>ycp</strong> and User name: <strong>faculty</strong> with PW: <strong>E&amp;CS</strong>.  After you have successfully logged in, the user name will be passed around as part of the Session information, and each subsequent servlet checks for a valid <strong>Session</strong> (a non-null “user” attribute) before responding to the request.  Note that this is <strong>NOT</strong> a secure method for handling credentials, but is used as an example for passing around and checking <strong>Session</strong> information.</p>

<p><strong>WARNING: You will receive an Academic Integrity Violation, as well as automatically fail the course, if you submit code as part of your Lab06 solution that was taken from any version of the LibraryExample Project that has ever been provided as part of this course.</strong></p>
