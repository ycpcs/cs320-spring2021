I"Â8<p>In this lab, you will practice using <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, which is currently the most widely used and arguably the best version control system.</p>

<p>In this course, we will mostly be using <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/egit/">EGit</a>, which is the Git client software built into Eclipse.  This lab will familiarize you with using EGit.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-start">Before you start</h2>

<p>Be aware of the following fact:</p>

<div class="callout">
Git has a bit of a learning curve.
</div>

<p>Ok, I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm downplaying the learning curve a bit here.  You will probably find Git to be fairly confusing for a while.  Eventually, it will make sense.  I promise.</p>

<p>As with most worthwhile skills, becoming proficient with Git takes some work.  The best advice is to <em>think carefully</em> about what you‚Äôre doing.</p>

<p>Another thing to keep in mind:</p>

<div class="callout">
Git is one of the most awesome and powerful software development tools ever created.
</div>

<p>Like <a href="../lectures/lecture10.html">OO Analysis</a>, Git proficiency is a software development super power.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-create-an-ssh-keypair">Step 1: Create an SSH keypair</h2>

<p>Execute the following commands in a Cygwin (Windows) or Linux terminal window, which take you to your home <strong>(H:)</strong> drive, and then lists the contents of the <strong>.ssh</strong> directory (if it already exists):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd h:
ls .ssh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If this command shows the files <strong>id_rsa</strong> and <strong>id_rsa.pub</strong>, you can skip the following steps, and proceed to Step 2.  Otherwise, execute the following command to create the .ssh folder on your h: drive.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mkdir .ssh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then execute the following command to generate the SSH key:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When prompted to enter the file in which to save the key, enter the following path and file name for the SSH key, otherwise the key will be stored at <strong>C:/Users/username/.ssh</strong> on the lab computer you are working on and will not be available to you on other lab computers:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa): /cygdrive/h/.ssh/id_rsa
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That will store your SSH key in the <strong>.ssh</strong> directory on your home drive.  If you are working on your own PC, you will likely need to use a different drive letter, as you might not have an <strong>H:</strong> drive.  Note the location where you stored the SSH key - you will need it later to configure Eclipse.</p>

<p>When prompted for a passphrase, just press enter (twice).</p>

<p>Again, if you are working on a lab computer, execute this command (which tells Eclipse where to find the SSH key):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>set Eclipse SSH2 home to H:\.ssh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you are working on your own PC, replace the above path with the path you specified when creating your SSH key.</p>

<h2 id="step-2-create-a-github-account">Step 2: Create a GitHub Account</h2>

<p>If you don‚Äôt already have a GitHub account, go to <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Pick a username, enter a valid email address (I strongly suggest your YCP address), and select a password.</p>

<p>Select ‚ÄúSign up for GitHub‚Äù.</p>

<p>Choose the free service - this is the default.</p>

<p>Verify your email address.</p>

<h2 id="step-3-add-your-public-key-to-your-github-account">Step 3: Add your public key to your GitHub account</h2>

<p>Log into <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Click on the <strong>Profile</strong> icon in the top right of the page (it looks like a green square sitting on a green table.)</p>

<p>Click on <strong>Settings</strong> in the dropdown list.</p>

<p>Click on the <strong>SSH and GPG keys</strong> item about 1/3 down the left side, in the <strong>Personal settings</strong> column.</p>

<p>Click the <strong>New SSH key</strong> button at the top right of the SSH Keys list.</p>

<p>Enter ‚ÄúYCP‚Äù as the title.  In a text editor <strong>Notepad++</strong> or <strong>Accessories ‚Üí Text Editor</strong>, open the file <strong>.ssh/id_rsa.pub</strong>.  Copy the entire text in this file, and paste it into the <strong>Key</strong> textbox.  Then press the <strong>Add SSH key</strong> button.  You might need to enter the password for your GitHub account.</p>

<h2 id="step-4-fork">Step 4: Fork</h2>

<p>Go to the following GitHub repository page:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/DonaldHakeII/MoveTheSquare">https://github.com/DonaldHakeII/MoveTheSquare</a></p>

<p>Click ‚ÄúClone or Download‚Äù and make sure that <strong>Clone with SSH</strong> is displayed for the clone credentials (just to the right of ‚ÄúFind file‚Äù). Click the <strong>Fork</strong> button (upper right button labelled ‚ÄúFork‚Äù under the Profile icon).  This will make a clone of this repository in your own GitHub account.  This will be your personal public repository for this lab.</p>

<p>The repository you just forked contains an Eclipse project called <strong>MoveTheSquare</strong>, a game engine that will be the basis for the next great indie game.  You will just need to add some additional gameplay features!</p>

<h2 id="step-5-configure-eclipse">Step 5: Configure Eclipse</h2>

<p>Start Eclipse.  Choose <strong>Window ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí</strong> to open the preferences dialog.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Choose <strong>General ‚Üí Network Connections ‚Üí SSH2</strong>.  Make sure that <strong>SSH2 home</strong> is set to the drive and path that lead to your <strong>/.ssh</strong> folder (include <strong>/.ssh</strong> in the path). For lab PC‚Äôs, this should be <strong>H:/.ssh</strong>.  Select OK when done.  Also verify that <strong>Private keys</strong> is set to the name of your private key file.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next, choose <strong>Team ‚Üí Git ‚Üí Configuration</strong>.  Use <strong>Add Entry‚Ä¶</strong> to create the following configuration entries:</p>

<blockquote>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Key</th>
        <th>Value</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>user.email</td>
        <td><em>your email</em></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>user.name</td>
        <td><em>your name</em></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>core.autocrlf</td>
        <td>true</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>core.fileMode</td>
        <td>false</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you are developing on Linux or MacOS, it should be fine to set <strong>core.fileMode</strong> to <strong>true</strong>.</p>

<p>Use appropriate values for <em>your email</em> and <em>your name</em>. If you would prefer not to reveal your real name and email address, that‚Äôs fine.</p>

<p>Also note the following:</p>

<div class="callout">
First, make sure that you spell everything correctly.  Eclipse will **NOT** point out any "errors", since you are specifying these keys and values.  Then press **Apply**.

It is <i>extremely</i> important that you set the <b>core.autocrlf</b> setting to <b>true</b>.  If you do not do this, you will experience horrible problems when you try to synchronize your work with your teammates' work.  You will also incur my wrath.  Do not incur my wrath.
</div>

<p>(If all of the members of your team are using Linux or MacOS, you will probably not need to worry about this.)</p>

<h2 id="step-6-clone-your-fork-of-the-repository">Step 6: Clone your fork of the repository</h2>

<p>In Eclipse, choose the <strong>Git</strong> perspective.  Click the ‚ÄúClone a Git Repository and add the clone to this view‚Äù button (3rd button from left in the Git Repositories perspective).</p>

<p>In the GitHub web page for the repository fork you created in Step 4, click on ‚ÄúMove the Square‚Äù under ‚ÄúYour repositories‚Äù.</p>

<p>In GitHub, select <strong>SSH</strong>, and then click the <strong>‚Äúcopy to clipboard‚Äù</strong> button to the right of the SSH URL and paste it into the <strong>URI</strong> tab of the Eclipse <strong>Clone Git Repository</strong> dialog.</p>

<p>In Eclipse, click <strong>Next</strong> twice.</p>

<p>The <strong>Local Destination</strong> window will now appear in Eclipse.  You can choose where you want to store the local repository: if using your laptop, store it locally on your hard drive; if using a lab PC, store it on H:/ (your home drive).   After you have specified a storage location, click <strong>Finish</strong>.</p>

<p>Next, in Eclipse, choose the <strong>Java</strong> perspective.  Choose <strong>File ‚Üí Import‚Ä¶ ‚Üí Git ‚Üí Projects from Git</strong>, followed by <strong>Existing local repository</strong>.  Select the <strong>MoveTheSquare</strong> repository and click <strong>Next</strong>.  Click <strong>Next</strong> two more times, then click <strong>Finish</strong>.  You should now have a <strong>MoveTheSquare</strong> project in your Eclipse workspace that is connected to your public repository (the fork you created in Step 4).</p>

<p>To test that you can pull from your remote repository, right click on ‚ÄúMove the Square‚Äù, and select <strong>Team ‚Üí Pull</strong> and you‚Äôll get a message box titled ‚ÄúPull Result for MoveTheSquare‚Äù that says that everything is up-to-date.</p>

<h2 id="step-7-make-changes">Step 7: Make changes</h2>

<p>You can run the program from <strong>src ‚Üí edu.ycp.cs320.movethesquare.ui</strong>, right clicking on <strong>GameView</strong> and choosing <strong>Run As ‚Üí Java Application</strong>.</p>

<p>Make some changes to the code:</p>

<ul>
  <li>change the colors</li>
  <li>make the square bigger or smaller</li>
  <li>use a circle instead of a square</li>
  <li>make the square move faster</li>
  <li>prevent the square from moving outside the boundaries of the window</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="step-8-commit-and-push-your-changes">Step 8: Commit and push your changes</h2>

<p>Once you have made a change, right-click on the <strong>Move The Square</strong> project and choose <strong>Team ‚Üí Commit</strong>.  Enter a log message describing your changes.  Select <strong>Commit</strong>.  This commits your changes to your local repository, but does not yet push (send) them to your remote repository at GitHub.</p>

<p>Next, right-click on <strong>Move The Square</strong> and choose <strong>Team ‚Üí Push</strong> or <strong>Team ‚Üí Push Branch</strong>.</p>

<p>A window for <strong>Push to branch in remote</strong> will appear.  You should see your comments displayed near the top, along with ‚Äúmaster‚Äù.  Select <strong>Next</strong>.  You will get the <strong>Push Confirmation</strong> window.  Select <strong>Finish</strong>.  If the push succeeds, you will see <strong>Pushed to git@github.com:‚Ä¶</strong>.  Select <strong>OK</strong>.</p>

<p>You should now be able to refresh your GitHub repository web pages and see the commit you just made.</p>

<p>In GitHub, if you click on ‚ÄúMoveTheSquare‚Äù you can explore and see all of the changes that have been made to the files in the project.  You can even view the code in GitHub. You will want to familiarize yourself with the GitHub interface for future use while developing our project.</p>

<h2 id="step-9-fetch-and-merge-changes-from-other-people">Step 9: Fetch and merge changes from other people</h2>

<p>Refer to the <a href="../resources/fetchMerge.html">Fetch/Merge</a> document for instructions on how to set up remote tracking branches to track the changes made by other people.</p>

<p>Find someone in the class whose changes you want to fetch and merge.</p>

<p>Using the Eclipse Git perspective, configure a <em>remote</em> for that person‚Äôs public repository.  Then return to the Java perspective and fetch changes from the remote.  Finally, merge changes from the remote tracking branch containing the changes you fetched.</p>

<h3 id="merge-conflicts">Merge conflicts</h3>

<p>If a merge does not cause any conflicts ‚Äî meaning that the changes you merged did not make edits to any parts of the code that you edited in your changes ‚Äî the merge succeeds and the result of the merge is committed to your private repository.</p>

<p>If the merge does cause conflicts, Eclipse will notify you and place a red conflict icon on all directories and files where conflicts occurred.  Eclipse will also add <em>conflict markers</em> in the source code to show you precisely where conflicts occurred, and to indicate what the conflicting text in each conflicting change was.  You will need to edit the code to remove the conflict markers and resolve the markers.</p>

<p>Once you have resolved a conflict, right-click on the file and choose <strong>Team ‚Üí Add</strong> to indicate that the contents of the file have been restored to a consistent state.</p>

<p>Once all conflicts are resolved, you can commit the result of the merge.</p>

<div class="callout">
Resolving merge conflicts is the most difficult part of using version control.  <b>Be careful</b> not to arbitrarily remove anyone else's code when you resolve a merge conflict.  If you are not sure what to do when a merge conflict occurs, <b>ask me for help</b>.
</div>

<p>If you see a merge conflict where a conflict marker shows a conflict between two identical or nearly-identical versions of the entire file, it means that you or someone you fetched changes from did not set the <strong>core.autocrlf</strong> property to <strong>true</strong>.  If that happens,</p>

<div class="callout">
<span style="font-size: 200%;"><i>Prepare to experience my wrath!</i></span>
</div>

<p>(Again, if no one on your team is using Windows, you will probably not need to worry about this.)</p>

<h3 id="pushing-following-a-merge">Pushing following a merge</h3>

<p>Once a merge has been completed, you should do a push so that your public repository is updated with the results of the merge.</p>
