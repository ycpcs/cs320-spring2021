title: "Assignment 4: Individual Project Milestones"
---

In the [Schedule](../schedule.html) you will notice days designated as individual project milestones.  These are opportunities for you to demonstrate progress on your individual project.

This document describes the expectations for each milestone.

*Important*: For each milestone, make sure you come to class prepared to demonstrate your work.  If there is any hardware or software you need, it is your responsibility to make sure it is available and working.

*Important*: Each individual milestone demo can be no longer than 2-4 minutes (in order for me to see all of the demos during class.)

## Expectations

**Milestone 1: Baseline Prototype**.  You should be ready to demonstrate some concrete progress on your project in the form of a basic prototype.  The prototype should support some of the functionality described in your proposal, but it can be in a very basic form. Include a one-two page document which describes what you have done for the first Milestone. You could include screenshots etc. in the document.

**Milestone 2: 50% Progress**: For this milestone, you should be about half of the way towards completion of the project.  There should be some substantial progress towards completing the proposed work.Include a one-two page document which describes what you have done for the second Milestone.


**Milestone 3: Final Project Demo**. This is the completed project.
