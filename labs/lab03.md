title: "Lab 3: Using Git"
---

In this lab, you will practice using [Git](http://git-scm.com/), which is currently the most widely used and arguably the best version control system.

Before you start
----------------

Be aware of the following fact:

<div class="callout">
Git has a bit of a learning curve.
</div>

It may be more than a bit of a learning curve. You will probably find Git to be fairly confusing for a while. Eventually, it will make sense. I promise.

As with most worthwhile skills, becoming proficient with Git takes some work. The best advice is to *think carefully* about what you’re doing.

Another thing to keep in mind:

<div class="callout">
Git is one of the most awesome and powerful software development tools ever created.
</div>

Like [OO Analysis](../lectures/lecture10.html), Git proficiency is a software development super power.

## Step 0: Become a Collaborator

Fill out the form [here](https://forms.gle/sEfwxLQhwJHbEZWo6) so that the tutors can add you as contributors to the repository. If you have not been added as a contributor, let your tutor know.

## Step 1: Clone

Go to the following GitHub repository page:

[https://github.com/KaiFish/MoveTheSquare.git](https://github.com/KaiFish/MoveTheSquare.git)

Using the git client of your choice (and the instructions from the lecture), clone the repository and extract the Eclipse Project into your workspace.

## Step 2: Branch

Following the instructions from the lecture, make a branch on the repository. Name it your ycp username.

## Step 3: Make changes

You can run the program from **src → edu.ycp.cs320.movethesquare.ui**, right clicking on **GameView** and choosing **Run As → Java Application**.

Make some changes to the code. Suggestions:

-   change the colors
-   make the square bigger or smaller
-   use a circle instead of a square
-   make the square move faster
-   prevent the square from moving outside the boundaries of the window

## Step 4: Commit and push your changes


Once you have made a change, commit your changes and push your branch to the remote repository.

## Step 5: Pull Request


Once you have pushed your branch, open a pull request. Consult the lecture if you need instructions. **DO NOT MERGE YOUR PULL REQUEST** We will look at these pull requests in the next git lecture.
